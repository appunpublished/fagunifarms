<section class="section" id="about">
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Faguni Organic Farm Stay is more than just a farm — it's a dream nurtured in the heart of rural Uttarakhand. What began as a simple desire to reconnect with the land and live a healthier, more intentional life has blossomed into a regenerative oasis for both people and planet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every inch of the farm is a tribute to sustainability. From the free-range Jersey cows that provide us with rich, A2 milk, to the carefully nurtured vegetables grown without synthetic inputs, everything is aligned with nature. But Faguni is more than a farming model — it's a movement. We invite you to be part of this story — whether as a guest, a collaborator, a customer, or a curious traveler.
  </p>

<section class="section" id="stay">
  <h2>Farm Stay</h2>
  <p>
    At Faguni Organic Farm Stay, your vacation isn't about escaping reality — it's about reconnecting with what truly matters. Our eco-friendly huts are nestled amidst fruit orchards, free-range animals, and lush Napier grass fields. Unlike overcrowded tourist spots or extreme mountain treks, our village farm stay offers a balanced experience — safe, accessible, authentic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just 15 minutes from Rudrapur Railway Station, and within 30–90 minutes you can explore Jim Corbett National Park, Corbett Waterfall, Girija Devi Temple, Kainchi Dham, Hanuman Garhi, Sita Van, Haripur Dam, and more.

  <h2>Training & Learning</h2>

  </p>

<section class="section" id="founder">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Faguni Organic Farm Stay began not with land, but with longing — a longing for clean air, honest food, and a life that felt truly alive. Founded by Mukul Nimker, a seasoned professional in the tech world, the farm was born out of a deep dissatisfaction with city life and a desire to reconnect with nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mukul's story is not just his own; it's a shared journey — one he invites you to walk with him. Whether you visit for a night, volunteer for a season, or just sit under a tree and reflect, you're part of something deeply real.

  <h2>Why Village Over Mountains?</h2>
  <p>
    Mountains are beautiful, but they aren’t for everyone. From altitude sickness and long travel hours to unpredictable weather and accessibility issues — high-altitude destinations come with hidden challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our farm stay in the plains offers the same tranquility, farmlands, forests, and fresh air — without any risks. Families with kids, senior citizens, or people with mobility issues can all experience nature safely and comfortably.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="mission">
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We exist to empower farmers, restore soil, reconnect people with their food, and protect indigenous livestock. Every product we grow and every experience we create is rooted in our love for the earth and all her beings.
  </p>
